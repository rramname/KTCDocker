# KTCDocker

In this project, we are runingÂ .core api project and angular 7 app in a docker container instead of running and deploying as 2 separate apps that talk to each other

we will have 2 applications, KnowThatCountryAPI which will be our dotnet core API project and KnowThatCountryUI, which will be our UI project which will get data from the API project.

In the end, we have docker-compose.yaml file to tie them up together.
